= Open Build Service - set_release Source Service

== Set Release Source Service

This service updates a RPM spec Release tag. The pattern to be used for the
Release tag is specified in the _service file.

=== Release Tag

The default Release tag uses two magic strings:

. CI_CNT <- number of commits

. B_CNT <- number of rebuilds (when the rebuild is triggerd)

The default setting is

----
Release: <CI_CNT>.<B_CNT>
----

The custom release string and the magic strings must be delimited by a ".".

Either CI_CNT or B_CNT must be part of the Release tag!

=== _service File

The Set Release Service will read the release pattern to be used from the _service file, eg:

----
<services>
  <service name="set_release">
    <param name="release">myrelease.CI_CNT.B_CNT</param>
  </service>
</services>
----

The magic strings must not be enclosed in angle brackets when specified in the
_service file!

The following parameters may be given in the _service file:

*release* - The release pattern to be used. Either CI_CNT or B_CNT must be part of
the Release pattern. This parameter is mandatory.

*file* - The spec file to be modified. May be given more then once. This parameter is optional. If
